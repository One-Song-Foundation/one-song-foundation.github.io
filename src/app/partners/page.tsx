                At One Song, we are always looking to partner with treatment centers providing excellent care. If you believe you are offering exceptional mental health or addiction treatment services, we would love to meet you and learn more about what you do.
              </p>
              <p className="text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                We understand that excellent care is not cheap, and many clients may not have the financial means to afford it. That's what we hope to address at One Song. By providing scholarships or grants, we can help more clients access transformative treatment and increase the effectiveness of their care.
